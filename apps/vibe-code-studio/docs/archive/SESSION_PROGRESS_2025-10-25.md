# Session Progress Report - October 25, 2025

## 🎯 Session Goal

Get DeepCode Editor working on Windows 11 for personal use with PowerShell and Git workflows.

---

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. Fixed E2E Test Syntax Errors

**Problem:** All 3 E2E tests had syntax errors (mixing Playwright/Vitest syntax)

**Solution:**

- Created new `tests/basic.spec.ts` with pure Playwright syntax
- 5 basic tests covering core functionality
- Renamed broken tests to `.broken` for later conversion
- Updated `playwright.config.ts` with correct port (5174)

**Result:** ✅ Playwright now finds 5 tests with no syntax errors

---

### 2. Verified Windows 11 Build

**Problem:** Needed to verify app can build on Windows 11

**Solution:**

- Ran `pnpm build` successfully
- Build completed in 1 minute 35 seconds
- Output: 46.42 kB main, 4.16 kB preload, ~3.8 MB renderer

**Result:** ✅ App builds successfully on Windows 11

---

### 3. Created PowerShell Helper Scripts

**Problem:** No easy way to run common tasks on Windows

**Solution:** Created 5 PowerShell scripts:

#### `dev.ps1` - Development Server

```powershell
.\dev.ps1  # Starts Electron with hot reload
```

#### `build.ps1` - Build Application

```powershell
.\build.ps1           # Production build
.\build.ps1 -Package  # Build + create installer
```

#### `test.ps1` - Run Tests

```powershell
.\test.ps1            # Unit tests only
.\test.ps1 -Coverage  # With coverage report
.\test.ps1 -E2E       # Include E2E tests
```

#### `quality.ps1` - Quality Checks

```powershell
.\quality.ps1         # TypeScript + ESLint + Tests
.\quality.ps1 -Fix    # Auto-fix linting issues
```

#### `clean.ps1` - Cleanup

```powershell
.\clean.ps1          # Remove build artifacts
.\clean.ps1 -Deep    # Deep clean + reinstall
```

**Result:** ✅ Complete PowerShell workflow established

---

### 4. Created Windows Quick Start Guide

**File:** `WINDOWS_QUICKSTART.md`

**Contents:**

- PowerShell script documentation
- Daily workflow examples
- Troubleshooting guide
- Project structure overview
- Configuration file reference
- Git workflow tips
- Windows Terminal setup

**Result:** ✅ Comprehensive documentation for Windows development

---

---

## ⏳ Pending Tasks

### High Priority

1. **Fix E2E Test Server Startup**
   - Issue: Dev server times out (database initialization error)
   - Impact: Can't run E2E tests
   - Solution: Fix better-sqlite3 loading or bypass database for tests

2. **Fix AutoFixService Tests (16 failures)**
   - Issue: `matchAll` error in response parsing
   - Impact: AutoFix feature may not work
   - Solution: Debug the matchAll usage

3. **Fix DatabaseService Tests (60 failures)**
   - Issue: Integration tests failing
   - Impact: Database operations may be unreliable
   - Solution: Fix better-sqlite3 integration on Windows

### Medium Priority

1. **Delete 75 Stale Documentation Files**
   - Issue: 75 COMPLETE.md files cluttering repo
   - Impact: Confusing documentation
   - Solution: Delete all PHASE_*, WEEK_*, SESSION_* files

2. **Manual Feature Testing**
   - Issue: Features claim to work but not E2E verified
   - Impact: Don't know if features actually work
   - Solution: Start dev server and test each feature manually

### Low Priority

1. **Verify Git Integration**
   - Issue: GitPanel exists but not tested
   - Impact: Git operations may not work
   - Solution: Open a git repo and test GitPanel features

2. Start dev server (`.\dev.ps1`)
3. Manually test all 7 features
4. Document what works vs. what doesn't

### Option B: Focus on Unit Tests

1. Fix AutoFixService (16 failures)
2. Fix DatabaseService (60 failures)
3. Get to 95%+ pass rate
4. Then tackle E2E tests

### Option C: Clean Up Documentation First

1. Delete 75 stale COMPLETE.md files
2. Update PROJECT_STATUS.md with reality
3. Consolidate documentation
4. Then fix tests

---

## 💡 Recommendations

### For Immediate Use

**If you just want to use the app:**

1. Try running `.\dev.ps1` and see if it works
2. If database error occurs, comment out database initialization temporarily
3. Test core features manually
4. Report what works/doesn't work

**If you want to fix it properly:**

1. Start with Option A (get dev server working)
2. Debug the better-sqlite3 error
3. Once dev server works, manually test features
4. Then fix failing unit tests

### For Long-Term Development

1. Set up automated E2E tests (after fixing server)
2. Increase test coverage to 50%+
3. Fix all failing unit tests
4. Clean up documentation debt
5. Establish daily git workflow
